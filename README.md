ParcelShops here to make your life easier
Visiting an Evri ParcelShop is just like popping to the shop to pick up milk, but instead you can send, receive, or return parcels with ease.

We’ve teamed up with over 5000 local stores to make sure you have everything you need, available to you 24/7. Here’s how they work:
- You can book online
- Or most of our shops have a Print-in-ParcelShop device, so you can do everything there. All you need is your parcel.
- Many are open 7 days a week with longer opening hours and you’ll often find free parking.
- If this doesn’t work for you, our lockers provide 24-hour access and a secure facility to send, receive and return your parcels

### The Embedded ParcelShop Finder Application

The system enables you to search and select Evri ParcelShops and/or Lockers based on user inputs. The style and functionality are all available ‘out of the box’ and requires minimal development effort to embed this within existing web journeys.
